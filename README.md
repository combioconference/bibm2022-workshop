# Description

With the advances of high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing platforms, sequencing data opens an unprecedented opportunity for genomic variant analysis at genome-wide scale or in single-cell resolution. To date, many algorithms have been designed to detect different types of variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small insertions and deletions (indels), and large structural variants (SVs). **Wide adoption of these algorithms and tools is expected to facilitate discovery and explicate the genetic causes of complex conditions and cancers.**

We invite investigators to contribute Original Research on computational methods of genome reconstruction, detecting and phasing variants. Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:


- Computational mathematical or machine learning models for genomic variants detection from short-read, linked-read and long-read sequencing data. 
- Novel methods for variant quality recalibration for downstream analysis.
- Novel methods for refinement of variants from up-stream variant callers 
- Algorithms for variant phasing in different types of sequencing data
- Genome assembly on human genome and metagenome
- New algorithms or tools to analyze copy number variations (CNVs) on single-cell RNA-seq data, single-cell DNA-seq data, spatial transcriptomics data, or other types of single cell data
- Computational tools for integration of different types of sequencing data for characterizing variants
- Algorithms to integrate variants (e.g., CNVs) from single-cell or bulk sequencing data to assist down-stream analysis in cancer studies 
Applications of advanced algorithms and sequencing technologies across a wide array of diseases
